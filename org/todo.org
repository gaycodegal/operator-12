* TODO Dialogue
** Make Textbox
   Look at button.lua and use this to create a textbox with changable text
   maybe a textbox with like a scroll through source option
   make it accept any background builder
* TODO Background Builder
** Solid Color
** Image
   Tile vs stretch
** TODO 9-slice
   Image:

   ABC
   DEF
   GHI

   The following points describe what happens when you change the dimensions of the image:
   - The four corners (A, C, G and I) do not change in size.
   - The B and H sections stretch or tile horizontally.
   - The D and F sections stretch or tile vertically.
   - The E section stretches or tiles both horizontally and vertically.
* TODO Layout
** Layout should have more than just resize
   like it should have a static onload function and should support additional static properties
   perhaps it should also have an onscroll function???
