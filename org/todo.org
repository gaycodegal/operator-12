* TODO Dialogue
** DONE Make Textbox
   CLOSED: [2018-07-29 Sun 21:27]
   Look at button.lua and use this to create a textbox with changable text
   maybe a textbox with like a 
** TODO scroll through source option
   make it accept any background builder
** TODO Data Structure
*** How will we know when a choice is available
	textref:{text, choices:{Choice(action, TextRef),...}
*** How will these be stored on the disk?
	Probably a dialogue folder
* TODO Background Builder
** Solid Color
** Image
   Tile vs stretch
** TODO 9-slice
   Image:

   ABC
   DEF
   GHI

   The following points describe what happens when you change the dimensions of the image:
   - The four corners (A, C, G and I) do not change in size.
   - The B and H sections stretch or tile horizontally.
   - The D and F sections stretch or tile vertically.
   - The E section stretches or tiles both horizontally and vertically.
* DONE Layout
  CLOSED: [2018-07-29 Sun 21:28]
** Layout should have more than just resize
   like it should have a static onload function and should support additional static properties
   perhaps it should also have an onscroll function???
*** DONE Additional Static Properties
