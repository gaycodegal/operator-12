# Contributing

Please run `make format` and test your C++ code before submitting a PR for review. It would also be appreciated (if there are merge conflicts at the time of your PR you `git rebase` off of master so that you can submit a PR without merge conflicts). At present there is no lua-formatter for the project.


## Other Software Required to Contriubte

- clang-format
- python 3.5+
	- Not *really* necessary, but I make quality of life scripts in python.
